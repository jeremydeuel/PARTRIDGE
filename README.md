## Protocol
Generally, follow xGen Protocol. Here, only the deviations are noted.
Use a 1 min less than the fragmentation time recommended for 350bp fragment length to generate slightly longer fragments. After ligating the full length adapters, clean up by adding 48µl Ampure XP beads to each sample and directly generate pools with a total of 500ng-4µg of DNA per pool. Use a SpeedVac to dry the samples after elution of DNA. For hybridisation use 4µL of 1µM pooled hybridistion capture probes (4pmol) and follow the xGen protocol. After washing, amplify by a total of 11 PCR cycles. Don't forget to inform the sequencing facility about the special settings needed to sequence the UMI barcodes (see xGen protocol for details).

# Bioinformatic analysis

## Overview

The program is run in several steps

1. Generate bam files
2. Extract insertions
3. Collect insertions
4. Gather evidence sequences and paired sequencing mates to identify retrotransposons
5. Manually annotate novel insertion sites
6. Measure Source Virus Coverage

## installation

* Use python3.13, https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130/
* Create virtual environment `python -m venv venv`
* activate virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate`
* install required packages `pip install -r env.txt`


* install HMMER v3.4 http://hmmer.org
* run `hmmpress resources/iap.hmm` to "press" the model.


* install samtools v1.22 https://www.htslib.org


* install R (v4.5.0, https://cran.r-project.org) and R Studio Desktop (v2025.05.0, https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
* install the required packages in R using `install.packages` and `BiocManager::install`.
```{r}
install.packages(c("ggplot2","openxlsx","dplyr", "BiocManager"))
BiocManager::install(c("GenomicRanges","Biostrings","GenomeInfoDb","BiocGenerics"))
```

## Step 1: Generate bam files

You need to generate bam files from your sequencing data. 
* trim sequencing adapters using [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic)
* align to the [GRCm39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000001635.27/) reference genome using [bwa-mem2](https://github.com/bwa-mem2/bwa-mem2)
* index the bam files using samtools 

There are plenty of tutorials on the internet indicating how to do this and you can have a look at the file [scripts/make_bams.sh](scripts/make_bams.sh) for an example.

## Step 2: Extract insertions
```{bash}
python partridge/isa_hmmer2.py [bam] [output] [threads]
```
Requirements (install with pip):
* see [env.txt](env.txt), use python [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to build your environment. I recommend python3.13, although 3.10+ is expected to work.
* HMMER, install from http://hmmer.org
* iap.hmm file, the path is set in the script on line 491. the model has to be "pressed" using hmmpress prior to usage `hmpress iap.hmm`

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
bam | path to bam file of an experiment, aligned, clipped and sorted by coordinate
output | path to output file of an experiment, tsv file
threads | number of threads to use, I recommend 6 for best performance

## Step 3: Collect insertions

`scripts/03_collect_insertions.Rmd`

It is best to run this script step-by-step in RStudio. First, download the .tsv files and save them in a folder `breakpoints`. The script then creates a file `isa_hmmer2_out.xlsx` containing all novel insertions that you need for the next step. The script also generates a file "isa.audit.xlsx" that is an aggregated view of novel insertions that can be used for manual checking (see Step 5)

## Step 4: Gather evidence sequences and paired sequencing mates to identify retrotransposons

```{bash}
python partridge/collect_evidence.py $SAMPLE_NAME
```
Note: You have to adjust the path to the excel file generated in Step 3 in the script, it is hardcoded. Also the input file and output file roots are hard-coded and might have to be adapted. I ran this step using a singularity container, the singularity definition file and the slurm submission scripts are also in the partride folder. But this script can also be run outside of a container using your venv. 

This script generates non-standard fasta files that can be used to manually check novel insertions, see next step.

## Step 5: Manually annotate novel insertion sites

Use these rules to manually annotate novel insertion sites
1.	A least one supporting read with >20bp of LTR coverage for each end of the LTR is present
2.	The insertion is not within an obviously repetitive region
3.	No reads have discordant starting points of the LTR
4.	There is a TSD of more than two bp and less than 30bp
5.	Both LTR ends map to the same LTR in the reference genome (>93% sequence identity)- and this LTR is part of an LTR pair (2-8kb apart)

Some information needed for this annotation can be found in the non-standard fasta files:

Practically, start with the file "isa.audit.xlsx" and generate columns to indicate passing of filtering and also a column indicating if the source IAP could be uniquely identified.

### Example of such a novel insertion verified in the evidence file

>RIGHT_MATE
```

`>RIGHT_CLIP` lists all sequences clipped to the right (in +-strand direction) whereas `>LEFT_CLIP` does the same for clips to the left.
In this example, 6 identical sequences starting with `TGTTATT...` can be found clipped to the right (one has some additional bases clipped by the aligner) and left-clipped sequences ending with `..CGGCTTCCCACA`.
To check which IAP this sequences belong to, paste the longest RIGHT_CLIP immeditately followed by "LEFT_CLIP" into the [UCSC BLAT](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat) tool and select the mm39 reference genome.
In this example, we paste `TGTTATTCGACGCGTTCTCACGACCGGCCAGGAAGAACACCACAGACCAGAATCTTCTGCGACAAAGCTTTATTCTTACATCT GGCTCATGCGCAGATTATTTGTTTACCAACTTAGAACACAGGATGTCAGCGCCATCTTGTGACGGCGAATGTGGGGGCGGCTTCCCACA`. The "mate" sequences can be used if the alignment is not unique (not necessary in this example)

```
We have four 100% hits, covering the entire sequence. Two of these hits are very close, these are both LTRs of a virus. In this case, the virus on chr3 is in the _Gm13710_ gene, whereas the IAP on chr2 is near the _Mbln1_ gene. This example was deliberately chosen, since both of these viruses are 100% sequence identical. Although it is not possible to identify which of these two viruses caused this novel insertion, so I count this very special case of IAP source virus (that jumps a lot!) as a single unique source.

## Step 6: Measure Source Virus Coverage

For this step, we only consider viruses manually validated (see step above). Make sure to annotate at least one source virus. If the source virus is not unique, annotate one hit, since it is important to calculate the coverage of the source virus to estimate VAF. The assumption is, that hybridisation capture enrichment has the same efficieny on the source and the destination virus, since both are sequence identical and the binding sequence of the hybridisation probe is thus also identical. Therefore, the ratio of coverage between destination (unknown zygosity / subclonal?) and the source (fixed in the genome and thus homozygous in inbred mouse strains) can be used to infer allelic frequency.

Use the R script `scripts/06_cluster_source_coverage.R`, which I run on the computing cluster. This file will calculate the source locus coverage. This script has to be lightly adapted to your circumstances and you especially have to adapt the list of source viruses you are interested in. It will output an excel file per bam file indicating the coverage per source locus.

# Example using test data

Using the file "test.bam" in the folder "test_data"

## Step 2
run on a single core
```
python partridge/isa_hmmer2.py test_data/test.bam test_data/test_step2.isa.tsv 1
```

this will generate a file test_step2.isa.tsv with a list of chimeric reads with evidence of an IAP insertion. The estimated run time is less than 1 second on an average laptop.

## Step 3
run 03_collect_insertions.Rmd in Rstudio. This will generate several files such as isa.audit.xlsx and isa_hmmer2_out.xlsx in test_data.

## Step 4

collect evidence using
```
python partridge/collect_evidence.py test
```
this will generate a file test_data/test.fa.gz, containing all evidence related to novel insertions. The estimated runtime is less than one second for the test data.

## Step 5

manually validate novel insertions. There is only one in this test data, `chr15:98805467-98805473`. Open test.fa.gz (e.g. `cat test_data/test.fa.gz | gzip -d` or use any text editor capable of viewing such files), then go through the rules
1.	**A least one supporting read with >20bp of LTR coverage for each end of the LTR is present** -> this is clearly the case, the right clipped sequence is  158bp long `TGTTATTCGACGCGTTCTCACGACCGGCCAGGAAGAACACAACAACCAGAATCTTCTACGGCAAAGCTTTATTGCTTACATCTTTTTGGGGCCAGAGTGTAAGAAGCAAGAGAGCGAGAAGCAAGAGAGAGAAGCAAGAGAGAGAGAGAAACGAAAC` and the left-clipped sequence is 145bp long `CCATGGCCGAGCTGACGTTCACGGGAAAAACAGAGTACAAGTAGTCGTAAATACCCTTGGCACATGCGCAGATTATTTGTTTACCACTTAGAACACAGGATGTCAACGCCATCTTGTGACGGCGAATGTGGGGGCGGCTCCCAAC` 
2.	**The insertion is not within an obviously repetitive region** -> use a genome browser, for instance https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=mm39. The location is inside an exon of Lmbr1, which is not a repetitive region. 
3.	**No reads have discordant starting points of the LTR** -> all reads have concordant starting points
4.	**There is a TSD of more than two bp and less than 30bp** -> the TSD is 6 bp (difference between both coordinates in the location), `AGGAGG`
5.	**Both LTR ends map to the same LTR in the reference genome (>93% sequence identity)- and this LTR is part of an LTR pair (2-8kb apart)** -> for this we use UCSC Blat and paste both ends RIGHT_CLIP and LEFT_CLIP immediately after each other. This reveales a 99% sequence identical hit in chr6:31776305-31776668 and chr6:31781207-31781570 which upon close inspection are both ends of an IAPEz immediately downstream of Gm43156.


since we now are sure that this is a genuine IAP insertion, open the file test_data/isa.audit.txt and add a new column "classification", then add "TRUE" to that column at the just verified insertion as well as a column "source" and add "chr6:31776305-31781572".

## Step 6
run `Rscript scripts/06_cluster_source_coverage.R`, this takes about 1 second on a local computer.

This will generate a file `isa.audit.source_coverage.xlsx` containing the coverage of the source virus for this file.

The allelic frequency can now be calculated: The source coverage for `chr6:31776305-31781572` is 287 (file isa.audit.source_coverage), whereas the coverage of the novel insertion is 6 (file isa_hmmer2_out.xlsx), thus the estimated allelic frequency of the novel insertion is 6/287 = 2.1%
